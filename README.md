# Challenges and Process of the Kumia Build

# First Challenge: Sass (Scss) package wasn't installed
This approach didn't install the package well, I think because Vite is what I used to bootstrap the project 
```
$ npm install -g sass
```
This command solved the issue. Thanks to (StackOverflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65589265/vite-how-to-use-sass]
```
$ npm install -D sass
```
